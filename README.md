Extensions and alternative functions for the Mocap Toolbox

Some of the files are adaptations of existing mocap toolbox functions. You should remove the original functions out of your Matlab path in order to ensure the new functions are used:
- mcinitanimpar (allow 3D animpar struct)
- mcanimate (allow 3D-animation)
- mcmocapgram (bugfix)
